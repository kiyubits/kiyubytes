## Welcome ^w^

Hi, I'm Kiyubits and I'm an aspiring university student looking to learn more about the world of physics, math and computer science.

My general plan for this blog is to document the silly coding/physics/math adventures I get into so that I can share some of the things I learned, and also so you can see what I'm working toward :D

I have no idea about the frequency of posts, I'll just post whenever I get around to it.

There is one post idea I have right now, and it's about how I managed to study physics everyday for 120 hours over the span of 137 days. I think it would be interesting to share some of the things I discovered about motivation/drive, passion and consistency. I could also share how I become more efficient at studying over time, and also maybe what kind of physics stuff I even learnt.

My hope for this blog is to slowly grow my collection of cool projects and skills so that I can look back and see how far I've come.

Here are some of my current goals.

- Learn and experiment with Quantum Computing
- Work on some Physics Simulation Projects
- Continue the Daily Physics Grind (working on a quantum mechanics textbook atm)
- Grind Leetcode Problems

Thanks for reading :)
